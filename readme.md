### Additional text

Traversing an infinity is a no small task indeed. Going in circles is by all means the same as going forever. Your path will never end, the road will never let you go. To think one can capture the effects of the infinity - is a crazy task indeed. But you're going to do it anyways, right? Then take the warning for what it is - and step further than anyone should ever go.
